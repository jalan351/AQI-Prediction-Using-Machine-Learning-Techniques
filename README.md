Air quality index (AQI) is a measure of air quality which describes the level of air pollution. Machine learning algorithms can help in predicting the AQI.
 For Prediction of AQI, Regression Models have been used i.e. Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression.Firstly I have calculated the index for each pollutant and taken highest sub-index as the AQI.AQI is the dependent variable which we have to predict and sub-indexes as the independent variable.Among all the models random forest gives the highest accuracy i.e. 0.98.
